Gen AES key to encrypt file:
openssl rand -out key.bin -hex 64

Encrypt file with gen AES key:
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in nistspecialpublication800-100.pdf -out encryptedpdf.enc -pass file:./key.bin

Encrypt generated AES key with provided public key:
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey public.pem -pubin -in key.bin -out key.bin.enc

The end user can now use his private key to decrypt the encrypted AES Key file, which he can use to decrypt the encrypted pdf file.
This can be done as follows;

Decrypt AES Key:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in key.bin.enc -out key.bin

Decrypt PDF using AES Key:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encryptedpdf.enc -out decryptedpdf.pdf -pass file:/key.bin
